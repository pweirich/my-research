# Perceptual Dialect Map of Indiana

This is a project that I worked on with Chelsea Bonhotal Kendrick.
I collected several dozen perceptual dialect maps from native residents of Indiana (Hoosiers).
Chelsea and I worked together to digitize and analyze the maps.
We presented this project at the IU Linguistics Conference in 2017 and at NWAV 46 in Madison, WI.
A paper based on this project has been submitted to _American Speech_ for review.

## Overview

**Research Questions:**
+ Where do Hoosiers believe people speak English differently in their state?
+ What attitudes or beliefs do Hoosiers have toward/about these varieties of English?

**Data Collection Technique:** Fieldwork

**Research Location:** Primarily in and around Bloomington, IN

**Number of Participants:** 68

**Type of Analysis:** Qualitative (content analysis), Quantitative (counts of labels)

**Analysis Tools:**
+ ArcGIS
+ QGIS
+ Python script
+ Classical content analysis

## Methods

Participants were presented with a blank map of Indiana and asked to perform two tasks:
1. Draw a line around places where you think people’s English sounds different.
2. Next, write down what you’d call that way of talking, if you can think of a label for it. Give an example of what’s different there (is it a word or pronunciation they use? Or a special way of talking?)

The maps were digitized, and the lines drawn by participants were traced into a GIS.
The labels provided by participants were extracted and subjected to a content analysis.
Aggregate heat maps were generated to summarize areas where Hoosiers believe different dialects of English are spoken in their state and what they call those ways of speaking.

## Results

The map below is an aggregate of all of the responses.
