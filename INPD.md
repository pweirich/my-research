# Perceptual Dialect Map of Indiana

This is a project that I worked on with Chelsea Bonhotal Kendrick.
I collected several dozen perceptual dialect maps from native residents of Indiana (Hoosiers).
Chelsea and I worked together to digitize and analyze the maps.
We presented this project at the IU Linguistics Conference in 2017 and at NWAV 46 in Madison, WI.
