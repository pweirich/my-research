# Perceptual Dialect Map of Indiana

This is a project that I worked on with Chelsea Bonhotal Kendrick.
I collected several dozen perceptual dialect maps from native residents of Indiana (Hoosiers).
Chelsea and I worked together to digitize and analyze the maps.
We presented this project at the IU Linguistics Conference in 2017 and at NWAV 46 in Madison, WI.
A paper based on this project has been submitted to _American Speech_ for review.

## Overview

**Research Questions:**
+ Where do Hoosiers believe people speak English differently in their state?
+ What attitudes or beliefs do Hoosiers have toward/about these varieties of English?

**Data Collection Technique:** Fieldwork

**Research Location:** Primarily in and around Bloomington, IN

**Number of Participants:** 68

**Type of Analysis:** Qualitative (content analysis), Quantitative (counts of labels)

**Analysis Tools:**
+ ArcGIS
+ QGIS
+ Python script
+ Classical content analysis

## Methods

Participants were presented with a blank map of Indiana and asked to perform two tasks:
1. Draw a line around places where you think people’s English sounds different.
2. Next, write down what you’d call that way of talking, if you can think of a label for it. Give an example of what’s different there (is it a word or pronunciation they use? Or a special way of talking?)

The maps were digitized, and the lines drawn by participants were traced into a GIS.
The labels provided by participants were extracted and subjected to a content analysis.
Aggregate heat maps were generated to summarize areas where Hoosiers believe different dialects of English are spoken in their state and what they call those ways of speaking.

## Results

The map below is an aggregate of all of the responses.
Notice that there are three distinct areas indicated: the northern border (in particular, the northwest corner near Chicago), Indianapolis (the capitol city in the center of the state), and the southern third of the state.

We can gain some further insights by seeing what people called these different areas.
It turns out that the northern area is actually three areas:
+ Chicago
+ General north
+ An extension of a neutral area

The southern part of the state appears to be uniformly considered "southern" as the map below shows.

But a further analysis of the labels given by participants show that the south is not a single area. Unlike the northern region, though, the south is not divided up into regions, rather it is divided by different associations people have with the south.
+ Rural
+ Twang
+ Drawl

## Takeaways

Hoosiers believe there are 3 or 4 dialect regions in their state.
They are certain that there is a Southern dialect and a Chicago dialect, but they are less certain about what the way of speaking in the other parts of the state.
Some people distinguish between a general Northern region and a middle region, but others say that it is all just a "neutral" or "standard" way of speaking.

An important takeaway is that people don't have a single, flat understanding of these dialect regions.
The Northern region can be associated with Chicago, a general idea of northern, and a standard way of speaking.
The Southern region can be associated with a general idea of southern, a rural way of life, and particular ways of speaking with a "twang" or a "drawl".
